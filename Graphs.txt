Graph is a collection of Vertices(Nodes) and edges. 
V is a set of Nodes.
E is the set of Edges(links between two vertices) or set of pair of vertices.
G= (V,E).
V = (V)
E = (V1,V2)

Undirected:
 unordered pair of edges i.e.
 E1(v1,v2) & E2(V2,V1) are same.

 V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

 E = {{0,1}, {0,2}, {0,3}, {1,0},{1,3},{1,4}, {2,0},{2,3}, {3,0},{3,1},{3,2},{3,4}, {4,1},{4,3}}

Directed or Digraph:
 ordered pair of edges.

 V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

 E = {<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <1,3>,<1,4>,<2,3>,<3,4>}


Degree:
 The number of edges on a Node.
 Pendant vertex - degree 1.
 Isolated vertex - degree 0.

Make using adjacency mattrix and matrix list;

DFS and BFS;
BFS - min spanning tree, shortest path, SEO, social network search
DFS - find path, solve puzzles with single solution, detect cycles

Shortest path- dijkstra/ Bellman-ford used in min delay path netowkring
Cycle Detection- Floyd cycle detection, detect deadlock
Min Spannign tree- no cycles and edge that connects all edges, Prims and Kruskal's

Strongly connected- if all the vertices reachable
loosely connected - if all vertices not reeachable
Graph coloring algo
